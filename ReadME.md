-- QUERIES:
```

## Task - Queries:

- [x]  Show the tables with the contents youâ€™ve inserted:
    
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM students;
    SELECT * FROM courses;
    SELECT * FROM categories;
    SELECT * FROM assignments;
    SELECT * FROM grades;
    ```
    

- [x]  Compute the average/highest/lowest score of an assignment:

```sql
--Average Score of an assignemnt 
SELECT AVG(points) AS average_score
FROM grades
WHERE assignment_id = 3;

-- Highest score of an assignment
SELECT MAX(points) AS highest_score
FROM grades
WHERE assignment_id = 3;

-- Lowest score of an assignment
SELECT MIN(points) AS lowest_score
FROM grades
WHERE assignment_id = 3;
```

- [x]  List all of the students in a given course:

```sql
SELECT students.first_name || ' ' || students.last_name AS student_name
FROM students
JOIN grades ON students.id = grades.student_id
JOIN assignments ON grades.assignment_id = assignments.id
JOIN categories ON assignments.category_id = categories.id
JOIN courses ON categories.course_id = courses.id
WHERE courses.course_name = 'Introduction to Programming';
```

- [x]  List all of the students in a course and all of their scores on every assignment:

```sql
SELECT students.first_name || ' ' || students.last_name AS student_name,
courses.course_name,
categories.category_name,
assignments.assignment_name,
grades.points
FROM students
JOIN grades ON students.id = grades.student_id
JOIN assignments ON grades.assignment_id = assignments.id
JOIN categories ON assignments.category_id = categories.id
JOIN courses ON categories.course_id = courses.id
WHERE courses.course_name = 'Introduction to Programming';
```

- [x]  Add an assignment to a course:

```sql
INSERT INTO assignments (category_id, assignment_name, total_points)
VALUES (1, 'Extra Participation', 5);
```

- [x]  Change the percentages of the categories for a course:

```sql
UPDATE categories
SET percentage = CASE category_name
WHEN 'Participation' THEN 15
WHEN 'Homework' THEN 15
WHEN 'Tests' THEN 50
WHEN 'Projects' THEN 20
END
WHERE course_id = 1;

```

- [x]  Add 2 points to the score of each student on an assignment:

```sql
UPDATE grades
SET points = points + 2
WHERE assignment_id = 2;
```

- [x]  Add 2 points just to those students whose last name contains a 'Q':

```sql
UPDATE grades
SET points = points + 2
WHERE assignment_id = 2
AND student_id IN (SELECT id FROM students WHERE last_name LIKE '%Q%');
```

- [x]  Compute the grade for a student:

```sql
SELECT students.first_name || ' ' || students.last_name AS student_name,
       courses.course_name,
       SUM(grades.points * assignments.total_points / 10 * categories.percentage / 100) AS final_grade
FROM students
JOIN grades ON students.id = grades.student_id
JOIN assignments ON grades.assignment_id = assignments.id
JOIN categories ON assignments.category_id = categories.id
JOIN courses ON categories.course_id = courses.id
WHERE students.first_name = 'John' AND students.last_name = 'Doe'
GROUP BY students.id, courses.id;
```

- [x]  Compute the grade for a student, where the lowest score for a given category is dropped:

```sql
SELECT students.first_name || ' ' || students.last_name AS student_name,
       courses.course_name,
       SUM((grades.points - minGrades.min_points) * assignments.total_points / 10 * categories.percentage / 100) AS final_grade
FROM students
JOIN grades ON students.id = grades.student_id
JOIN assignments ON grades.assignment_id = assignments.id
JOIN categories ON assignments.category_id = categories.id
JOIN courses ON categories.course_id = courses.id
JOIN (
  SELECT grades.student_id, assignments.category_id, MIN(grades.points) AS min_points
  FROM grades
  JOIN assignments ON grades.assignment_id = assignments.id
  GROUP BY grades.student_id, assignments.category_id
) minGrades ON (
  minGrades.student_id = grades.student_id
  AND minGrades.category_id = categories.id
)
WHERE students.first_name = 'John' AND students.last_name = 'Doe'
GROUP BY students.id, courses.id;
```
